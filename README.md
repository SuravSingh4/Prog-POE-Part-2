# Step 1: Launching the Application

When you first start the application, the main window will open with two primary options:

Local Events and Announcements
Report Issues
You can interact with these options by clicking the respective buttons.

#   Step   2: Viewing Local Events and Announcements

Clicking the Local Events and Announcements button will open a new window that shows a list of upcoming local events. These events are categorized into various types such as:

Community events,
Festivals,
Holidays,
Markets
Each event is stored in an internal data structure (like a dictionary) based on the date. This allows you to view events happening soon or on specific dates.

# Step 3: Searching for Events

At the top of the events page, there’s a search bar with a Search button. You can type any keyword related to an event in the search bar, for example, "Festival" or "Market".

Once you hit the search button, the system will look through all the events and display any that match your search term. The search is case-insensitive, meaning it doesn't matter whether you use uppercase or lowercase letters.

If the search finds matching events, it will notify you with the number of events found. If no matches are found, it will let you know that no events were located for your search term.

# Step 4: Navigating Back

If you want to return to the main menu, there’s a Back button at the top of the events page. Clicking this will close the current window and take you back to the main screen where you can choose another option.

# Step 5: Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues in your community (like a pothole or a broken streetlight), you can click on the Report Issues button from the main menu. This will open a form where you can describe the problem and submit it to the system.

# Step 6: Exiting the Application

When you're done using the application, you can close the windows using the standard window controls (the X button in the top-right corner) to exit.

The application is designed to be user-friendly, with a focus on helping users stay informed about local events and report issues quickly. It's ideal for anyone looking to engage with their local community or contribute to improving municipal services.
